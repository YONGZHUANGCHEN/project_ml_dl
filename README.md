# Project machine learning approach


This section is the code for the machine learning part of the project. A total of 2 data sets are used.

test1_data1 is the model built using dataset 1

test1_data2 is the model built using dataset 2

test1_data1_test_data2 Test the model built by dataset 2 with dataset 1

test1_data2_test_data1 Test the model built by dataset 1 with dataset 2
